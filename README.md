## 1) Superstore Sales Dashboard

As my first Tableau project. I have used dataset from the tableau website: superstore sales (https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/sample_-_superstore.xls)
This sample dataset contains information about products, sales, and profits that is used to identify key performance indicators within this fictitious company.

Skills Used:

- Cohort Analysis - demonstrated customer behavior over time by grouping them into cohorts based on their first purchase date. 
- Created advanced visualizations like scatter plots and heatmaps to explore relationships and patterns in the data.
- Formatting visualizations with labels, colors, and titles.
- Data blending and connected multiple data sources like Products, sales and profits data.
- Utilized parameters to allow users to interactively change segmentation criteria
- Designed an interactive dashboard with filters and actions to drill down into specific segments.
- Applied filters to focus on specific time periods or product categories.
