## 1) Superstore Sales Dashboard

As my first Tableau project. I have used dataset from the tableau website: superstore sales (https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/sample_-_superstore.xls)
This sample dataset contains information about products, sales, and profits that is used to identify key performance indicators within this fictitious company.

Skills Used:

- Applying filters to focus on specific time periods or product categories.
- Formatting visualizations with labels, colors, and titles.
- Data blending and connecting multiple data sources like Products, sales and profits data.
- Utilizing parameters to allow users to interactively change segmentation criteria
- Designing an interactive dashboard with filters and actions to drill down into specific segments.
